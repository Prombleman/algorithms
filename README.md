# **Algorytmy ze szko≈Çy**

This repository contains **algorithms** and coding exercises that I have implemented during my school years. It includes a variety of algorithms and data structures, used to solve problems and improve programming skills.

## **Included Algorithms**

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Dynamic programming solutions
- Recursive algorithms
- Other basic data structures (e.g., Linked List, Stack, Queue)

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Languages**: Mainly written in **C**, **Python**, and **Java**.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, and Queues.

## **Current Status**

This is a **collection of school exercises** that might not follow best practices but serve as great learning resources. Feel free to explore, adapt, and improve the algorithms.

## **Contributing**

If you have suggestions for better solutions or improvements, feel free to fork the repository, open issues, or submit pull requests.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Future Enhancements**

- Add more complex algorithms.
- Improve the efficiency of current algorithms.
- Write better documentation for each algorithm.
